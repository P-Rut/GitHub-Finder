# Github Finder 

React app to search Github profiles.
This app uses the Context API along with the useContext and useReducer hooks for state management and is part of the "Modern React Front To Back" Udemy course. 
The course is made by one and only https://github.com/bradtraversy and definitely helped me in understanding how to work with useContext and useReducer hooks for state management while also consolidated my skills in React ðŸ˜ƒ
